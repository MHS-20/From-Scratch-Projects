## Virtual Switch for VPNs endpoints

This project implements a virtual switch (vSwitch) for VPN endpoints. The vSwitch facilitates communication between virtual network interfaces (TAP devices) and manages the forwarding of Ethernet frames between these interfaces.

+ `vPort`: client of the vSwitch, represents a virtual interface (TAP device) connected to the vSwitch It's responsible for sending and receiving Ethernet frames to and from the vSwitch.

+ `vSwitch`: manages the forwarding of Ethernet frames between vPorts. It stores MAC addresses of vPorts and forwards frames based on the destination MAC address.

Set up TAP devices and compile the project: 
```
sudo ./setup.sh
compile.sh
```
<br>


Run the server:
```
vswitch <port>
```
<br>


Run the client
```
vport <serverIp> <serverPort>
```
<br>


Clear binaries: 
```
cleanup.sh 
```

### Ethernet Frame Format
The Ethernet frame format used in this project is as follows:
```
+-----------------------------------------------+
|             Destination MAC Address           |   (6 bytes)
+-----------------------------------------------+
|             Source MAC Address                |   (6 bytes)
+-----------------------------------------------+
|             EtherType / Length                |   (2 bytes)
+-----------------------------------------------|
|                                               |
|                Payload / Data                 |   (46â€“1500 bytes)
|                                               |
+-----------------------------------------------+
|             Frame Check Sequence (FCS)        |   (4 bytes)
+-----------------------------------------------+
